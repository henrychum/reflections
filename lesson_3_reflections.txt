When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
In case you lose your computer or your computer somehow stops working, you can keep your repositories somewhere else so you don't lose your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if someone else working on your project on github but you also want to work on your local repository, the constant updates could create problems with your work.
