When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
In case you lose your computer or your computer somehow stops working, you can keep your repositories somewhere else so you don't lose your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if someone else working on your project on github but you also want to work on your local repository, the constant updates could create problems with your work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a way to clone a repository on GitHub to your own profile; it is only for GitHub. Clone is a way to 'clone' a respository in general, whether it is local to local or remote to local. Branching is a way to stray away from the 'main project' you're working on at that point to try something different on the same project. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It is always nice to have a copy of the remote saved locally because there you will always be able to refer to it or be able to merge with it when you are done working on your portion of the project on your own branch. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would have someone else use my laptop whenever they would want to make changes. Yes this would be harder to do without Git and GitHub because Git and GitHub allows users to share copies of their work through the internet. It's basically a social network for programmers.
