What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It gets me closer to saving the repository allowing me to save my work. I need to do it because saving my work is essential in programming if you want to get creative and bold. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It acts as a an in-between place from working directory and repository so you can sort out your files on what you want to make into a reposity from your working directory. It offers almost like a loading zone before the cargo gets to the store kind of deal, to allow the luxury of choosing which cargo goes where.
